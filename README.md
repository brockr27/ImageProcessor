# ImageProcessor
A project I worked on that allows you to manipulate Portable Pixmap format (.ppm) images in several different ways. For testing purposes I included a few files.

# Caveats
- The output filename must be different than the input filename.
- The image files must be of .ppm format, specifically "P3"
